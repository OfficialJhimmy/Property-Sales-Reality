 # Property Sales Reality - A Real-Estate Company.

This project's major objective was to display available properties that were listed in Lagos, Nigeria. Properties can be filtered by the following criteria: luxury, featured, for sale, and for rent. Additionally, it has a page called the "admin dashboard" that acts as the app's content management system. Firebase and React.Js were used to build this project.
